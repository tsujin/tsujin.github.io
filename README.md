# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my knowledge and projects in cybersecurity. The site features an interactive guide to common security protocols, attacks, and misconfigurations.

## Current Content

- **Landing Page**: A modern homepage with navigation to different sections of the portfolio.
- **Cybersecurity Guide**: An interactive page with a sidebar navigation listing various security topics. Clicking on any item displays detailed information including descriptions and prevention strategies for:
  - Security Protocols (HTTPS, TLS, SSH, IPsec, OAuth, SAML)
  - Common Attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, MitM, Phishing, DoS, Buffer Overflow)
  - Misconfigurations (Weak Passwords, Unpatched Software, Open Ports, etc.)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 with modern features like gradients, flexbox, and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Deployment

To deploy this site on GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `yourusername.github.io` (for a personal site) or any name for a project site.
2. Push this code to the repository.
3. Go to Settings > Pages, select the branch (usually main), and set the source to root.
4. The site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/` or `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`.

## Future Plans

This portfolio will be expanded with additional projects, blog posts, and demonstrations of cybersecurity concepts and tools.
